## Course Objectives:
- Understand the formulation of several popular regression, classification and unsupervised machine learning models
- Properly use and tune parameters for these machine learning algorithms
- Understand some of the fundamental concepts in statistical learning, such as the bias-variance trade-off, cross-validation, statistical simulation, nonparametric estimations and optimization
- Use `R` to perform data cleaning and model fitting, evaluation and be able to interpret the results
- Use `RMarkdown` to organize your report with proper visualization of the data and results
- Be able to utilize modern AI tools to assist your analysis and gain learning experience



Tentative subjects include:

- Supervised Learning:
  - Linear models and penalization
  - Discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, logistic regression
  - ùêæK nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees, random forest, kernel regression
  - Support vector machine
- Unsupervised Learning:
  - PCA, K-mean and hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, spectral clustering
- Concepts:
  - Bias-variance trade-off
  - Variable selection
  - Cross-validation
  - Bootstrap
  - Numerical optimization
- Modeling problems:
  - Personalized Medicine
  - Imaging data



## Prerequisites: 
A course that covers linear regression and uses `R`, such as STAT 420/425. **Good knowledge of probability and statistics (STAT400) and preliminaries of linear algebra (MATH 415) are also assumed**.. 

## Textbooks: 
1. Supplemental: **SMLR** - [Statistical Learning and Machine Learning with R](https://teazrq.github.io/SMLR/). This is my ongoing project that will contain most of the course material.
2. Supplemental: **ISL** - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani
3. Supplemental: **ESL** - [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman. This is a more advanced textbook.
